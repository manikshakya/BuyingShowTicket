# BuyingShowTicket
Calculate the waiting time of the visitor.

Alex plans on visiting the museum and is at the counter to purchase tickets to get in. Tickets are sold only one at a time. If a visitor needs more than one ticket, he/she has to pass through the queue again to buy each one.

 

Given the number of visitors and the number of tickets each visitor needs, determine the amount of time Alex requires to buy the number needed. Alex's place in the queue will be given. Each transaction takes 1 unit of time. and the time taken to go to the back of the line can be ignored.

 

For instance if n = 3 visitors need tickets = [1, 2, 5] tickets each, and Alex is at index 1, the first six units of time, t = 0 through t = 5, are as shown below:
